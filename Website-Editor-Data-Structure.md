**DEPRECATED: the data structure is now implemented and maintained in README**

---

This wiki documents the JSON data structure in wedding website (i.e., for both couple view and guest view). BE and FE should follow this skeleton.

When it comes to implement the actual features, we may identify needs to refactor a bit. When it happens, please discuss with Lyndsey (or Torrey) to review and update it.
